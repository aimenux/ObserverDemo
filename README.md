# Welcome to ObserverDemo !

> **Reminder** (wikipedia def) : observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the *subject*, maintains a list of its dependents, called *observers*, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

Here are 6 different implementations of observer design pattern. 
Each implementation is illustrated through an example.
Each example contains two projects : a library and a console application.

**Technical requirements** : VS 17, .NET 4.6.1

## Example1
> classical, language independent (do not use language-specific concepts)
subject is aware of observers (maintains a collection of observers and iterate over them in order to call update operation)
observer is aware of subject (maintains a reference on observer that will be used when update method is called)
